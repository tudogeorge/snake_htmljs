        <h1> The Snake game - an HTML implementation </h1>
        <p>
            <h2> Data structure </h2>
            The data structure used to represent the snake's "bodyparts" (the head, tail and the waypoints): a Doubly-Linked List.<br/>
            The waypoints are cells where the head changed it's direction. Waypoints are fixed whereas the head and tail are moving.<br/>
            
            <h3> Nodes </h3>
            Each "node" in that list keeps the following information:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li> The X,Y coordinates </li>
                <li> The direction - when the tail node reaches a waypoint, it (the tail) takes the direction stored in the waypoint. </li>
                <li> The old direction - important for the proper display of the waypoints, see for example the "dir&lt;OldDirection&gt;&lt;Direction&gt;" css classes. It's also used for validating direction change commands. </li>
                <li> What kind of body part is it ("H", "T" or "W", as in the "bodyPartClasses" variable) </li>
            </ul>
            The waypoints are generated at the position of the head, when the user changes the snake's direction.<br/>
            The direction field is self-explanatory for the head node. For the waypoints it is the (new) direction that the head took when the waypoint was generated.<br/>
            
            <h3>The algorithm </h3>
            ...is quite simple:
            <ol>
                <li> The Snake constructor is called with the game surface's row and column counts
                    <ol>
                        <li> The node list is instantiated with a head and a tail in the middle of the game surface, moving to the Right </li>
                        <li> The snake is drawn on the surface </li>
                        <li> A Interval of some hardcoded milliseconds is setup that calls the advance() method </li>
                        <li> A keydown event handler is setup for the document which (after some validation) registers the direction in which the user wants to lead the snake </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> The advance() method does the rest:
                    <ol>
                        <li> //The head: </li>
                        <li> Computes the head's new location according to it's direction </li>
                        <li> Checks whether the head will go outside the gaming surface or over it's own body, in which case it calls the gameOver method and returns </li>
                        <li> Calls the food dispenser's checkCell method to see wether there's anything to "eat" at the new location </li>
                        <li> "Clears" the old location (only keeping it's body class) </li>
                        <li> If a change in direction was requested in the "onkeydown" handler, then a new waypoint is generated with the head's old position and direction and inserted just before the head by calling the DLList's insertBefore method. The waypoint is marked with the appropriate css classes </li>
                        <li> The new head's position is marked with the appropriate css classes according to it's bodypart and direction </li>
                        <li> //The tail: </li>
                        <li> Checks whether the snake needs to grow (the cntLeft2Grow property), in which case cntLeft2Grow is decremented and the following steps are ignored </li>
                        <li> Computes the tail's new position according to it's direction </li>
                        <li> Checks whether the tail's newly computed position is over the last waypoint. If it is, then the tail takes that waypoint's direction and deletes it </li>
                        <li> The tail's old position is cleared of all of it's snake-body-related css classes </li>
                        <li> The tail's new position is marked according to it's bodypart and direction </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> Graphics </h3>
            The game surface is a HTML table, generated at document load with some set dimensions (rowcount, column count).<br/>
            The various types of cells are given css classes according to their status (in or out of the snake, and if inside then according to whatever bodypart and direction is to be applied).</br>
            
            <h3> Gameplay </h3>
            The game surface is 15 cells high by 40 cells wide.<br/>
            The snake's speed is hard-coded and constant at about 10 blocks / second. The player controls the direction of travel by pressing the arrow keys.<br/>
            At any given time there is a food or reward item displayed on the game surface; at the time, there are four types of these, as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> Egg: when eaten it causes the snake to grow by 3 cells. </li>
                <li> Burger: the snake grows by 5 cells. </li>
                <li> Crosshairs: when eaten it gives the player 3 "sniper shots". </li>
                <li> Spinner: it gives the player one "vortex shot". </li>
            </ol>
            <h4> The Sniper Shots </h4>
            <i> TLDR: Lets the snake automatically change course (one time) towards it's prey, without the player having to press any key. </i><br/>
            The player gets 3 sniper shots when the snake eats a "crosshairs" symbol.</br>
            A sniper shot is used by pressing the "X" key, at which moment the game displays a vertical or horizontal line (the "line of sight"), perpendicular to the snake's direction of travel, between the food item that's displayed on the surface and the snake's direction.<br/>
            If the line of sight encounters the snake's body then the drawing stops, it won't reach the snake's direction of travel and the shot is wasted.
            If the snake changes direction while a line of sight is displayed then the line of sight disappears and so the shot is again wasted.
            When the snake's head reaches the line of sight it will automatically change direction towards the food item, without the player having to give any direction change commands.

            <h4> The Vortex </h4>
            <i> TLDR: Allows the snake to enter the walls and emerge on the opposite side. </i><br/>
            The player gets one vortex shot when the snake eats a spinner symbol. <br/>
            A vortex shot is fired by the user pressing the "V" key. At that moment, provided the snake's body doesn't obstruct the path between the snake's head and the wall towards which it is moving, a spinner on a green background is displayed next to the place where the head will enter the wall. Also a spinner on a red background is displayed on the opposite side, where the snake will emerge.<br/>
            The vortex shot is wasted if the snake's body obstructs the line between the snake's head and the wall towards which it is headed.
